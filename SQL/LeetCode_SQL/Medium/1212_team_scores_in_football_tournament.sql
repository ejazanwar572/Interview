1212. Team Scores in Football Tournament
Difficulty: Medium
Table Names: Teams, Matches
Table: Teams
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |
Each row of this table represents a single football team.
Table: Matches
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     |
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams.
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the Teams table (team_id), and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals, respectively.
You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
- A team receives 3 points if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).
- A team receives 1 point if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).
- A team receives 0 points if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).
Write an SQL query to select the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches.
Return the result table ordered by num_points in descending order. In case of a tie, order the records by team_id in ascending order.
Example:
Input:
Teams table:
+---------+--------------+
| team_id | team_name    |
+---------+--------------+
| 10      | Leetcode FC  |
| 20      | NewYork FC   |
| 30      | Atlanta FC   |
| 40      | Chicago FC   |
| 50      | Toronto FC   |
+---------+--------------+
Matches table:
+----------+-----------+------------+------------+-------------+
| match_id | host_team | guest_team | host_goals | guest_goals |
+----------+-----------+------------+------------+-------------+
| 1        | 10        | 20         | 3          | 0           |
| 2        | 30        | 10         | 2          | 2           |
| 3        | 10        | 50         | 5          | 1           |
| 4        | 20        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
| 5        | 50        | 30         | 1          | 0           |
+----------+-----------+------------+------------+-------------+
Output:
+---------+-------------+------------+
| team_id | team_name   | num_points |
+---------+-------------+------------+
| 10      | Leetcode FC | 7          |
| 20      | NewYork FC  | 3          |
| 50      | Toronto FC  | 3          |
| 30      | Atlanta FC  | 1          |
| 40      | Chicago FC  | 0          |
