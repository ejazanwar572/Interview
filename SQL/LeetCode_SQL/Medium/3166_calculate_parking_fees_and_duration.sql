## Description

Table: ParkingTransactions

| lot_id       | int       |
| car_id       | int       |
| entry_time   | datetime  |
| exit_time    | datetime  |
| fee_paid     | decimal   |
Each row of this table contains the ID of the parking lot, the ID of the car, the entry and exit times, and the fee paid for the parking duration.

Write a solution to find the total parking fee paid by each car across all parking lots, and the average hourly fee (rounded to 2 decimal places) paid by each car. Also, find the parking lot where each car spent the most total time.

Return the result table ordered by car_id<b> </b>in<b> ascending </b> order.

Note: Test cases are generated in such a way that an individual car cannot be in multiple parking lots at the same time.

The result format is in the following example.

Example:

Input:

ParkingTransactions table:

+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+
| lot_id | car_id | entry_time          | exit_time           | fee_paid |
+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+
| 1      | 1001   | 2023-06-01 08:00:00 | 2023-06-01 10:30:00 | 5.00     |

+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+

Output:

+--------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
| car_id | total_fee_paid | avg_hourly_fee | most_time_lot |
+--------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
| 1001   | 18.00          | 2.40           | 1             |
| 1002   | 6.00           | 1.33           | 2             |
