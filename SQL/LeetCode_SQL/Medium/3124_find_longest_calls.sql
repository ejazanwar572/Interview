## Description

Table: Contacts

| id          | int     |
| first_name  | varchar |
| last_name   | varchar |
id is a foreign key (reference column) to Calls table.
Each row of this table contains id, first_name, and last_name.

Table: Calls

| contact_id  | int  |
| type        | enum |
| duration    | int  |
type is an ENUM (category) type of ('incoming', 'outgoing').
Each row of this table contains information about calls, comprising of contact_id, type, and duration in seconds.

Write a solution to find the <b>three longest </b>incoming and outgoing calls.

Return the result table ordered by type, duration, and first_name in descending order and duration must be formatted as HH:MM:SS.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:

Contacts table:

+----+------------+-----------+
| id | first_name | last_name |
+----+------------+-----------+
| 1  | John       | Doe       |
| 2  | Jane       | Smith     |
| 3  | Alice      | Johnson   |
| 4  | Michael    | Brown     |
| 5  | Emily      | Davis     |
+----+------------+-----------+

Calls table:

+------------+----------+----------+
| contact_id | type     | duration |
+------------+----------+----------+
| 1          | incoming | 120      |
| 1          | outgoing | 180      |
| 2          | incoming | 300      |
| 2          | outgoing | 240      |
| 3          | incoming | 150      |
| 3          | outgoing | 360      |
| 4          | incoming | 420      |
| 4          | outgoing | 200      |
| 5          | incoming | 180      |
| 5          | outgoing | 280      |
+------------+----------+----------+

Output:

+-----------+----------+-------------------+
| first_name| type     | duration_formatted|
+-----------+----------+-------------------+
| Alice     | outgoing | 00:06:00          |
| Emily     | outgoing | 00:04:40          |
| Jane      | outgoing | 00:04:00          |
| Michael   | incoming | 00:07:00          |
| Jane      | incoming | 00:05:00          |
| Emily     | incoming | 00:03:00          |
+-----------+----------+-------------------+

Explanation:

	- Alice had an outgoing call lasting 6 minutes.
	- Emily had an outgoing call lasting 4 minutes and 40 seconds.
	- Jane had an outgoing call lasting 4 minutes.
	- Michael had an incoming call lasting 7 minutes.
	- Jane had an incoming call lasting 5 minutes.
	- Emily had an incoming call lasting 3 minutes.

<b>Note:</b> Output table is sorted by type, duration, and first_name in descending order.
